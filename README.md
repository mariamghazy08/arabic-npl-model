# Mu'arrib: Arabic NLP Model

Most intelligent systems lack the ability to accurately classify
Arabic sentences according to their grammatical type, especially
given the wide variety in sentence structure and grammatical
styles. Furthermore, traditional solutions often rely on explicit
linguistic rules, making them inflexible in the face of linguistic
diversity .
Developing an intelligent model capable of accurately classifying
Arabic sentences into nominal and verbal types using deep learning
techniques (AraBERTv2).
Facilitating the process of learning the Arabic language for primary
school students through an interactive tool that helps them
distinguish between sentence types and understand their
grammaticalcomponents.
Designing a model that can later be integrated into educational
applications to help students practice linguistic analysis skills in an
interactive and simpleway.
Achieving high classification accuracy to provide a reliable model that
can be used in educational environments, whether inside the
classroom orin smart educational applications..
